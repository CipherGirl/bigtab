# BigTab

## Roadmap

- Refactoring
- Tabs should be unique unless they are being sent to a new group
- Track Last Visited & Frequency of Visits for Search Ranking
- Select Default Group for Settings via Context Menu
- Search should tokenize keywords and rank results on frequency + recency
- Keyboard Shortcuts for all click events
- Capture Selection Data when Tab is Saved
- Allow Items to be Deleted via Popup Page
- Allow Items to be Reordered within a Group & Between Groups via Popup Page
- Default Sort when Searching sorts by Group
- Add & Remove Groups from Popup Page
- Restore All Tabs in Group from Popup Page
- Open All Search Results on Enter in Input
- On Clicking Group Tab, Filter Search to only within that Group
